#Rules Agreement
This version of the mod is specifically designed for the BlS minetest server. It shows a formspec on first join of a player. It greets new players with a list of questions and then the rules. It can be configured so the player who doesn't accept the rules is kicked/banned or even do nothing.


##Configuration
Almost everything can be configured in `rules.lua` and `config.lua`
Even more languages can be added as your liking

###Notice
1. This mod is based off (https://github.com/ChaosWormz/mt_terms_of_use)

2. If a player select the "I'm just roaming around", the rules prompt will show up everytime they log in, until they accept the rules.

3. If a player accepts the rules and got the quiz, the rules prompt won't show up again.
